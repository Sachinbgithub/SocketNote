   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

### Accessing the Application

Once started, you'll see output similar to:
```

============================================
```

- **Local access**: Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser
- **Network access**: Other devices on your network can access using the displayed IP addresses

### Basic Usage

1. **Create Folders**: Click "New Folder" to create organizational folders
2. **Create Notes**: Select a folder and click "New Note" to create notes
3. **Edit Notes**: Click on any note to open the rich text editor
4. **Upload Files**: Use the upload button in the note editor to attach images
5. **Search**: Use the search bar to find notes and folders
6. **Backup**: Use the backup manager (database icon) to export/import data

### Markdown Support

The note editor supports Markdown formatting:
- **Bold**: `**text**`
- **Italic**: `*text*`
- **Headers**: `# H1`, `## H2`, etc.
- **Lists**: `- item` or `1. item`
- **Code**: `` `code` `` for inline, ``` ``` ``` for blocks

- **Images**: `![alt](image-url)`

### Code Syntax Highlighting

The editor automatically detects and highlights code in various languages:
- JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS, SQL
- And many more supported by Prism.js

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the server directory:

```env
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development
```

### Database Configuration

The SQLite database is automatically created at `server/database.sqlite`. The database includes:
- Folders table with nested structure
- Notes table with content and metadata
- Attachments table for file references

### File Storage

Uploaded files are stored in `server/uploads/` with unique filenames to prevent conflicts.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port already in use**
   - Change the port in the `.env` file or kill the process using the port

2. **Database errors**
   - Delete `server/database.sqlite` and run `npm run init-db` again

3. **File upload fails**
   - Check that the `server/uploads/` directory exists and is writable
   - Verify file size is under 10MB
   - Ensure file type is supported (JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP)

4. **Network access issues**
   - Check firewall settings
   - Ensure devices are on the same network
   - Verify the server IP address is correct

### Development Tips

- Use browser developer tools to check for console errors
- Check server logs for backend errors
- Use the network tab to debug API requests
- Clear browser cache if UI changes don't appear
